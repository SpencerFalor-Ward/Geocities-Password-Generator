# [HW-3--PasswordGenerator](https://spencerfalor-ward.github.io/HW-3---passwordGenerator/)
JavaScript **HW#3-Password Generator**, *....enter JavaScript!!<strong>!</strong>*

## Goal for the project
My goal for this project is to practice using JavaScript and to start my journey towards **becoming comfortable with nested code** - *vars in ifs in loops in functions to console log and repeat* 

We were given the following guidelines to complete a page that generates a randome password for the user.

>User Story
>AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
>I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
>SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

>Business Context
>For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can >generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

>Acceptance Criteria
>GIVEN that a user needs a new, secure password
>WHEN prompted for password criteria
>THEN a password is generated

  <strong>:bomb::bomb:It took a *long* time to look this good:bomb::bomb:</strong>

After starting this I thuoght it would be funny to try an make my page look like a very reliable and secure place to get a password. To do this I purposly made it look dated and simple, via it's asthetics, as well as implimenting a visually annoying blink to emmulate buggy code. I lost much sleep to accomplish this trival joke, but it makes me laugh, and I hope the user at least chuckles.

## Benefits of this project
- **Practice JavaScritp** alone and in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
- Thinking in JavaScript
  - Variables, Objects, Functions 
  - :thinking::confounded::triumph:

## Hurddles 
The dificulties about this project are as follows:
- JavaScript - Full stop.
  - As always, adding my own personal touch with out getting to *deep in the weeds*. I did not do a very good job with this this time. I spent hours to make my page look as it does, simply to fullfill a simple joke that I thought was funny.
- Staying focused!
  - *all my best distractions live in the same machine as this project*
